  mirrors:
    type: string
    description: |
      A YAML describing one or more repositories to mirror.
      The YAML is structured as a list of maps, with each map including
      the "deb-line" and "pub-key" mandatory fields, and the "archs" and
      "version" optional fields. For instance:

        - deb-line: http[s]://[<user>:<pass>@]<hostname>/<path> <suite> <components>
          pub-key: GPG public key for validating the repository
          archs: source i386 amd64
          version: 18.10
          pocket: xenial-updates
        - deb-line: ...
          pub-key: ...

      The archs field defaults to "source i386 amd64".
      The version field, if not specified, is omitted.
      The pocket is the dists subdirectory where the Release file can be found
      locally. The pocket must uniquely identify a mirror. If not specified, it
      defaults to the value of the suite from the deb-line. In any case, the
      codename in the Release file is generated from the pocket prefix, so
      that, for instance, "trusty", "trusty-updates" and "trusty-foo-bar" will
      all have "trusty" as their codename.

      The charm is blocked until this config value is provided.

  auth-cache-enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether authorization caching is enabled.
      When enabled, both successful and unauthorized responses from the
      auth backend are cached. The cache expires or is deleted based on
      the "auth-cache-duration" and "auth-cache-inactivity" options below.
      Even when this option is set to true, caching is really only enabled
      when this application is related to an auth backend, like
      esm-auth-server.
    default: false
  auth-cache-duration:
    type: string
    description: Cache duration before expiration, like "15m" or "1h".
    default: 1h
  auth-cache-inactivity:
    type: string
    description: Cache inactivity before invalidation, like "15m" or "1h".
    default: 10m
  packages-require-auth:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether the Packages-Require-Authorization field must be included in the
      Release file. This field provides a hint that package downloads will
      require authorization, hence allowing clients to prevent use of this
      repository if authorization has not been provided, avoiding problems with
      failing downloads.
    default: false
