      A YAML describing one or more repositories to mirror.
      The YAML is structured as a list of maps, with each map including
      the "deb-line" and "pub-key" mandatory fields, and the "archs" and
      "version" optional fields. For instance:

        - deb-line: http[s]://[<user>:<pass>@]<hostname>/<path> <suite> <components>
          pub-key: GPG public key for validating the repository
          archs: source i386 amd64
          version: 18.10
        - deb-line: ...
          pub-key: ...

      The archs field defaults to "source i386 amd64".
      The version field, if not specified, is omitted.
      The charm is blocked until this config value is provided.

  auth-cache-time:
